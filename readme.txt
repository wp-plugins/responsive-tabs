A responsive and clean way to display your content. Create new tabs in no-time (custom type) and copy-paste the shortcode into any post/page.

This plugin adds a “Tabs” section to the admin panel which allows you to create tabbed content for your website the easy way. You can quickly add your content to your different tabs, choose a color, a breakpoint, re-order them at anytime and display them anywhere with a simple shortcode. What you see is what you get, and it’s totally free.
